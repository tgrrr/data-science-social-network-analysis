## Problem or Question Construction

- [ ] Must include at least one source of social media and networks.
- [ ] Must include a graph or network and its analysis/processing to solve a problem.
- [ ] Must include some element of analysis using social media and networks, and something we learnt in class. It cannot be all machine learning for example.
- [ ] Your analyst or solution is in Python (no R, including visualisation), but parts of it could be done in
other languages, e.g., Javascript if you decide to prototype a front end on website.
- [ ] All code should be your own, you can leverage packages such as `networkx` etc., but it shouldn’t be copied from an existing solution.

### Team Management & Mentoring

- [ ] Use timesheets
- [ ] Set up regular meetings within your team
- [ ] We've setup a slack channel
- [ ] Github repo: TODO:
- [ ] Meet lecturers 3 times before assignment due

The next component is to gather the necessary data, proceed with your analysis and iterate. For this part, we encourage you to use any of the tools and techniques we have studied in class, but you are also most welcome to use techniques you have studied in other classes – e.g., data visualisation, time series, machine learning etc.

- [ ] Gather necessary data
- [ ] Proceed with your analysis and iterate
- [ ] Data visualisation, time series, machine learning etc.

## 2. Assessment Criteria

This assessment will determine your ability to:

- [ ] Analyse and problem-solving skills developed in course and assignment 1 to use social media & network analysis to solve or answer data related questions/problems
- [ ] Collect and explore data
- [ ] Develop written and verbal communication of describing the problem, approach, analysis, insights and justification of approach taken.

## 3. Learning Outcomes

This assessment is relevant to the following Learning Outcomes:

- [ ] 1. Apply data science to analyse social media and social networks
- [ ] 2. Analyse social networks by finding communities, identifying important nodes, and influence
propagation
- [ ] 3. Analyse social media by applying Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to detect sentiment and events
- [ ] 4. Describe the theoretical concepts behind the social media and network analytical approaches
- [ ] 5. Synthesise and present insights from the social media and network analysis performed

NOTE: As a rough rule of thumb, you can get a credit if you just used the code we learnt in class, but to get a high distinction would require you doing some research and going beyond what we did in class.

## 6. What to submit

- [ ] Your report, up to 30 A4 pages in length and in font size 12 of assessed content, not including appendices. Note this is a maximum, not a length you need to must have. Anything beyond 30 pages will not be read, and anything in appendix should be considered as additional information, as there is no guarantee it will be read. Please do not ask for more pages, this limit is strict.
- [ ] Your scripts used to perform your analysis. Please comment and style the code, as we will read them. Note that we may also ask you to explain the code and why you chose particular coding choices.
- [ ] Share access with me to your code and/or document shared repository or drive. Include the details how I can access it.
- [ ] Timesheets, project plans, individual self-reflection (max of one A4 page)
- [ ] A sample of the data, no more than 10 Mb in size.

## Presentation

- [ ] Presentation slides

## 9. Rubric/assessment criteria for marking

### Excellent criteria:

#### Problem Formulation (15%)

  - [ ] and scope is realistic.

#### Teamwork and Management (10%)

- [ ] Team functions well and have effective management procedures. 
- [ ] Have a well-designed project plan, weekly plans. 
- [ ] Timesheets are realistically filled in and 
  - [ ] individual self-reflection is insightful and reflects thought has been given to what worked, 
  - [ ] what didn’t and how to improve in the future.
- [ ] Met with Jeff at least 3 times.

#### Approach (20%)

- [ ] The approach is an appropriate method to take to solve the problem or answer the analytical question. 
- [ ] Approach taken goes beyond using the tools provided in class. 
- [ ] Team justifies and explains their approach well. Approach includes data collected and techniques used.

#### Analysis/result & Discussion (20%)

- [ ] Problem solving: The solution solves the problem well and all the success criteria are satisfied. 
- [ ] Team is able to provide analytical and/or empirical evidence of this.
- [ ] Answering analytical question & Analysis component: 
  - [ ] Excellent discussion of results that answers the question proposed 
    - [ ] or contributes towards solving the problem. 
  - [ ] Conclusions are supported by analytical and/or empirical evidence. 
  - [ ] All success criteria are answered.

#### Report Presentation (10%)

- [ ] Report is easy to read and flows well. 
- [ ] It is structured well, leading the reader through the process of 
   - [ ] answering the questions 
   - [ ] or solving the problem. 
- [ ] Tables, figures and other visualisation are easy to read and to interpret.

#### Group presentation (25%)

- [ ] Presentation is well structured, clear and easy to follow by master students. 
- [ ] It is engaging and interesting and able to capture the audience’s attention. 
- [ ] A candidate for best presentation.


### As a guide about the scope of problems that are doable, consider the following:

- Depression and suicide alert on social media
- Beyond statistics, who is the best and most influential cricketer?
- Who is the centre of the Marvel/Nintendo universe? Can we promote Browser to be the most
central Nintendo head honcho?
- Github & communities – all things about community analysis on Github.
- Donald vs Kim – who has the bigger ego?
- Social Media Neighbourhood Watch – Alerts for where, when and what crimes are been committed in Melbourne?
