I did not know you could change the `__signature__` of the function\r\n\r\nThis is madness...\r\n```Python\r\nfrom inspect import signature, Parameter\r\n\r\ndef foo(**kwargs):\r\n    return FloatSlider(**kwargs)\r\n\r\nfoo.__signature__ = signature(foo).replace(parameters=[\r\n    Parameter(name='min', kind=Parameter.KEYWORD_ONLY), \r\n    Parameter(name='max', kind=Parameter.KEYWORD_ONLY)\r\n])\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt does the trick, ipython will autocomplete `min` and `max` arguments. I'm not sure I would put it in my code though. Not really feeling confident about it.\r\n\r\nThe thing is that changing the signature does not change the way it is called by Python. Meaning that this code:\r\n```Python\r\ndef foo(x, y): \r\n     print(\"Hello\")\r\n\r\nfoo.__signature__ = signature(foo).replace(parameters=[\r\n    Parameter(name='x', kind=Parameter.POSITIONAL_OR_KEYWORD), \r\n    Parameter(name='name', kind=Parameter.POSITIONAL_OR_KEYWORD)\r\n])\r\n\r\nfoo(name=4, x=5)\r\n```\r\nleads to `TypeError: foo() got an unexpected keyword argument 'name'`\r\n\r\nSo I guess changing the signature is only safe if the function was originally taking `*args, **kwargs` as arguments.",

There are also some good resources on youtube if you prefer videos. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

We could iterate only on a few but again this still raises above problem about exhausting iterators. I disagree that assignment to _ is useless anyway, as you proved you used it in list. Generators also represent sometime large computation (dask for example). Lazyness is on purpose and peaking at the first element could have arbitrary side effects.\r\n\r\nIf you want to register a display hook that does this you can do it without changing IPython source. But it will not be the default.\r\n\r\nHistory the completed was trying to be smart about looking in generators and it was more trouble than anything, even sometime triggering external API call which broke some prod system.

So a global statement like `n += 1` will have weird effects. \r\n\r\nWe actually do not run things in global scope, but create an anonymous function and run _this function_. So in your example, Gloop is not really globlal.\r\n\r\nI'm pretty sure starting your timeit with `global Gloop` should work around the issue. It's just quite hard.\r\n\r\nIf you findtime to send a pull-request to fix it I'll be happy to try to review it; I unfortunately won't have the time myself.\r\n\r\n",

(see [`compile()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#compile) ) doc. \r\n\r\nWe have to [manually](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/blob/f14271fe2b0f9627f64848466de944befc7c29c9/IPython/core/interactiveshell.py#L3190-L3221) tweak the execution semantinc, which [`%%timeit` does](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/blob/master/IPython/core/magics/execution.py#L1124-L1137), and [`%%time` does not](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/blob/master/IPython/core/magics/execution.py#L1264-L1270). \r\n\r\n\r\nThere is a lot of legacy code in these area, so it might be simple nowdays maybe just replace the last ast node by an interactive one ? \r\n\r\nIt is not inherently hard, but might require quite a bit of poking around. \r\n\r\n",

For general help with Jupyter use [discourse](https://discourse.jupyter.org).  This will allow to keep the number of opened issue on the IPython repo under control and allow you to get faster response.\r\n\r\n-- \r\n\r\nFrom what I know about  jupyter notebooks and windows, this may look like an issue with an antivirus or firewall that block websocket. \r\n\r\nThanks, ",

For general help use [discourse](https://discourse.jupyter.org).  This will allow to keep the number of opened issue on the IPython repo under control and allow you to get faster response.\r\n\r\nYou also seem to be searching for help for a project that _uses_ ipython; maybe [nornir](https://github.com/nornir-automation/nornir), pydantic or ansible. I've never heard of the first two until today so will not be able to help you much. \r\n\r\nClosing as there is not much actionable from my end, but feel free to keep commenting",

So this is often a reason why id will not be the same: objects might not be freed. \r\n\r\nSecond, IPython makes _a lot_ of potential modification to the AST, and does execute block statement one-by-one by walking the top-level of the AST (this allows for example to have top level await)\r\n\r\nThus when you thin you do:\r\n\r\n```\r\ncode = \"\"\"\r\nl = [1,2,3]\r\nl_id = id(l)\r\ndel l\r\ng = [1,2,3]\r\nid(g) == l_id # True\"\"\"\r\nexec(code)\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou are actually doing:\r\n```\r\nfor c in code.splitlines():\r\n     do_internal_stuff()\r\n     kinda_exec(c)\r\n     more_internal_stuff()\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo it is quite likely that more objects are created \"in between\" your lines of code.\r\n\r\nYou can actually look at [how we execute code](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/blob/4a2240fb440c497e9e195d9ff43d96973b7ae33f/IPython/core/interactiveshell.py#L3137) ...it's quite complicated because of backward compat, but you might be able to get it down to  a couple dozen lines in a basic case to see what it is doing.\r\n\r\nHope that helps.",

Flag that a likely outcome is that they will be rolled into the normal release process, but depending on the impact assessment we might choose to push out dedicated security releases.\r\n\r\nThe OpenSSL designations can be a bit sketchy as far as our use of OpenSSL goes, so it might be best not to read too much into \"LOW\" (as far as Node is concerned it may range from \"zero impact cause we don't touch any of these things\" to \"concerning enough that users will probably want this asap\").",

As you can see from the stack trace, the function that sets up coverage is `setupCoverageHooks` in `lib/internal/bootstrap/pre_execution.js`, so that\u2019s likely what you\u2019d want to modify. There are also other examples of warnings being emitted in that file that you can take a look at.\r\n\r\nAs for contributing in general, https://github.com/nodejs/node/blob/master/doc/guides/contributing/pull-requests.md and https://github.com/nodejs/node/blob/master/doc/guides/writing-tests.md are probably helpful starting points. And if you run any trouble, feel free to ping me here or on Twitter or IRC (or generally feel free to ask a question in #node-dev on Freenode).",

If you can do something with `SecurePair`, you can do it with `TLSSocket`, too.\r\n- As of 9301b8a9c69d1, `SecurePair` is implemented in terms of `TLSSocket`, so the overhead of having this second implementation is neglegible and I personally wouldn\u2019t have an issue with removing the runtime deprecation on it.\r\n\r\nThat being said:\r\n\r\n- You can probably make this work by using the fact that you can pass any Duplex stream, not just network sockets, as the first argument to `new TLSSocket(stream)`.\r\n- If you do want to stick to the `SecurePair` API, you can also consider copying the [implementation from Node core](https://github.com/nodejs/node/blob/30e919a3cfd663ec3f1d971dcdb9970ff8a4779e/lib/tls.js#L284-L311) (less than 30 lines of JS code + the `DuplexPair` utility, which is published to npm as [`duplexpair`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/duplexpair)), and use that.\r\n\r\nDoes this help you?",

Every time this thumbnail loads, that request go through the proxy function I have showed above. Thumbnail size is less than 1MB in most of the cases. That is why I explained there is a high usage of pipe function in my app. Appreciate if you can provide a answer with these details. Just need to know the impact of piping. No exact answer needed.",

Why are `let` and `const` considered _lexical declarations_ and `var`s are not?\r\n2. How are `var`s called (if they are not _lexical declarations_)?\r\n3. Why `let` and `const` had been in the same category (from my perspective as a user: the category of visible from the outside) as `var`s in Node 0.12.x and in 4.x and in newer versions are separate?\r\nThanks",

Neither of `-latomic -lrt` are required to link node on ubuntu/gcc or centos7/devtoolset\r\n2. ubuntu gcc seems to ignore unused link libs, devtoolset seems to generate executables with a reference to them.\r\n\r\nAs to why that is, or what can be done about it, still looking.\r\n\r\nOn our side, the obvious fix would be to not specify unnecessary libraries on the node link lines.  I tried removing `ppc64le` from the platforms that need `-latomic` and got a working binary on ubuntu and centos7. I'd have to add a conditional to do the same for `-lrt` (it looks to be the POSIX.4 realtime APIs).\r\n\r\n\r\n@targos any comment on that? The link libs seem to have been added with V8 7.5, https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/28005 from https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/27375, but since v8 doesn't build on ppc64le (to my knowlege), they might just have added them to be safe, on the assumption they'd be unused if they weren't needed.",

The meaning of calling `stream.destroy()` varies greatly. Some streams see it as \"hey there is an error, shutdown immediately\" other more modern ones see it as a \"i'm automatically called after success to close resources\".\r\n\r\nI don't think it's pipelines responsibility to force call this and I think this will cause breakage in the ecosystem as it's a new assumption. Testing the various permutations of streams is obvs super tricky as it's a peer dep here.\r\n\r\nI think the main places calling destroy() explicitly here are the same cases that are using autoDestroy in the first place.\r\n\r\nCorollary to the above. If we detect autoDestroy to be set we should just simply wait for `close` to be emitted before considering the stream to be \"done\" done instead of waiting for end/finish. We should strongly encourage everyone to move to autoDestroy and *everything* becomes easier down the line.",

A quick fix would be to simply make empty buffers and strings a noop in `Writable.write` and `Readable.push`. However, I'm still very interested in whats going wrong here.\r\n\r\nAlso I'm not 100% convinced this is related to your http issue. But we can get to that. If I give you a patch can you build Node and run your HTTP case to see if it solves it?",

I'm saying this because v10.15.3's profiling used to work fine.\r\n\r\nOne environmental change that occurred before this started happening is that I tried to enable dtrace inside of SIP using `csrutil`, and that's when this started happening. But after resetting SIP (`csrutil reset`) and even turning off SIP (`csrutil disable`), the problem persists, so I'm not 100% sure it relates to that. Maybe is a good hint for macOS experts?",

Even without normalizing input data, you can still get better performance by tuning some hyper parameters. Please check very similar code on TF [website](https://colab.sandbox.google.com/github/tensorflow/docs/blob/r2.0rc/site/en/r2/tutorials/quickstart/beginner.ipynb). If you want better performance, then change learning rate, optimization, normalize data etc.\r\n\r\nI am closing the issue as it is resolved.

Good question!\r\nI am not sure if `libtensorflow_framework.so` must exist, but there are 2 reasons why I thought it should exist:\r\n\r\n- It was existing before in previous versions. When compiling a custom TF operator in 2.0.0rc2, I obtained `ltensorflow_framework` linking error (it was working in TF 1.14). I had to create a symbolic link `libtensorflow_framework.so` pointing to `libtensorflow_framework.so.2` for it to work.\r\n\r\n- When I checked on my Mac (TF 2.0.0rc2), in `/Users/username/.env/python3/lib/python3.7/site-packages/tensorflow_core` there are 3 files:\r\n`libtensorflow_framework.2.0.0.dylib`, `libtensorflow_framework.2.dylib`, `libtensorflow_framework.dylib`. While I'm not sure why all these 3 files should exist, I believe they do for a good reason, which might be the same reason why `libtensorflow_framework.so` should exist on a Linux machine.\r\n\r\nJust my thoughts though...",

But I have an observation which I will like to clarify. The example only runs to completion if the below code statement is included:\r\n\r\n```\r\ntry:\r\n  # %tensorflow_version only exists in Colab.\r\n  %tensorflow_version 2.x\r\nexcept Exception:\r\n  pass\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe comment written on it states it only exist on google colab. If its not included the Titanic code fails at any point where a tensor is is being converted to numpy. If all I have said so far hold true, how do we implement something similar on Jupyter notebook?  I have read that eager execution can achieve this but I don't know how to implement correctly and how it may differ between Jupyter and google collab. Thanks in advance.",

The reason being that in tensorflow 2.0 contrib module is being depricated but transform sill uses contrib module as shown [here](https://github.com/tensorflow/transform/blob/11afcff467f779ba6163686395582e69603987d1/tensorflow_transform/analyzers.py#L47). So, when you try to import tensorflow transform, you are trying to import contrib module associated with Transform and this contrib module is not available in Tensorflow 2.0 and hence the error. Hope this clarifies the issue here. ",

The reason being that in tensorflow 2.0 contrib module is being depricated but transform sill uses contrib module as shown here. So, when you try to import tensorflow transform, you are trying to import contrib module associated with Transform and this contrib module is not available in Tensorflow 2.0 and hence the error. Hope this clarifies the issue here.\n> \n> \u2014\n> You are receiving this because you were mentioned.\n> Reply to this email directly, view it on GitHub, or mute the thread.\n",

I still couldn't find exactly what was wrong, but it seemed that the .fit() method doesn't like to be called in loop, this somehow creates things. I was able to partially subdue this problem by calling `tf.keras.backend.clear_session()` however that only slowed the memory leaked, it didn't stop it.\r\n\r\nI managed to fix this problem by replacing .fit() with .train_on_batch() method. Now my model is stable and I can run for n epochs without it crashing. I hope this helped some",

It is very appreciated :)\r\n\r\nMy environment:\r\n\r\n-Operating system: Windows 10\r\n-TensorFlow version: 1.13.1 (C library: libtensorflow-gpu-windows-x86_64-1.13.1)\r\n-Visual Studio version: 2017\r\n\r\nI had checked out that link before and while it has a ton of useful information it is the C++ API, not the C API. For example, the author uses the \"FreezeSavedModel\" method that doesn't exist in the C API.\r\n\r\nI've built C++ code (using the TF **C** API!) for loading and running a model created in Python but I would like to be able to train a model in C++ (using the TF **C** API!) and freeze it before saving it to the harddrive. I know how to train a model but don't know how to freeze it using the TF C API.\r\n\r\nI have tried to find any information regarding this online but couldn't find any. So, my question is about freezing a model but using the C API not the C++ API. Any pointers or pseudo code would help.\r\n\r\nThanks again for your time, rmothukuru!\r\n\r\n\r\n",

One problem - very slowly. About 15 sec. I need at least 4-5. Okay, I will think about context class for them. For example in My MainActivity. But anyway it is about creating them and allocate, righ? And I need to use three ByteBuffer in one moment and every time put new arrays in them(it's not fast too). I understand that I work with three arrays and they are big arrays but can I do it more fastly also in other ways? Need I use ByteArray anyway? Can I put as inputs my array considering that Tflite doc says tha input may be primitive array.",

Users shouldn't need to add this to their `fit` call manually. Arguably we could check to see if a ProgBarLogger callback already exists before automatically adding, but as this doesn't crash anything and just duplicates the outputs I'm OK with leaving it like this for now. Please feel free to submit a PR though!",

There are some layers (BatchNorm, Dropout) that are enabled during training and disabled while evaluation. If you disable `BatchNorm` and run the training (`model.fit`) and Evaluation (`model.evaluate`), the results are very very close (upto 3rd ot 4th decimal). Please check the [gist here](https://colab.sandbox.google.com/gist/jvishnuvardhan/735dcb2ba93dbbfd0574214765eabffd/tf33031.ipynb). Please check the colab gist and let us know what you think.

I think the behavior is expected, as per [the point](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/compat/v1/set_random_seed), \r\n\r\n> If the graph-level seed is not set, but the operation seed is set: A default graph-level seed and the specified operation seed are used to determine the random sequence. \r\n\r\nIt is because, in Eager Execution, there will not be Graph Level Seed, as there will be no graph at all. So, they will be two independent Random Tensor Operations.\r\n\r\nPlease let me know your opinion about the same. Thanks.",

In the line `x = ...`, a `tf.random.uniform` kernel is used and its internal state changed; in the line `y = ...`, the same kernel is used again but its internal state has been changed. The two `tf.random.uniform` will only produce identical numbers in eager mode if you put `tf.random.set_seed(...)` before each of them. The updated docstring for `set_seed` (https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/python/framework/random_seed.py#L191) explains those caveats. Alternatively you can use stateless random ops (https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/random/stateless_uniform) or the new stateful random ops (https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/random/experimental/Generator).",

In general, if you place yourself as a user, I think you had better import from `tensorflow.keras`, which is the intended public display of tensorflow's submodules (if you simply `import tensorflow`, you have access to `tensorflow.keras`, but not to `tensorflow.python`). The `python` term in the imports refers to the source code organization, and is therefore preferably used when writing source code (which then uses utility functions to reformat its public naming at import time), although you may sometimes need to use it to access specific back-end functionalities which are normally not made public.",

In 1 qps, mkl is slower than without mkl.  In 60qps, when decreasing inter threads pool size,  My App runtime cannot use more cpu. When adding the size, there are too many threads to running. I try serveral times from 1 to 64, finally, for the best performance, I set just 1 thread pool size  . Therefore, i give up to using mkl tf 1.8",

I am currently working on aliasing them to their normal counterparts (Model.fit_generator -> Model.fit, etc) which will restore graph based optimizations. (Including those around memory use.) In the mean time, you can switch to `Model.fit` and `Model.evaluate` directly in your code. Sorry for the inconvenience.",

Both versions I have working use the `Layout` to coordinate panel guides, which (like the other guides) are resolved and trained at draw time (i.e., `ggplot_gtable()`). The `Coord` is responsible for generating a set of guides that it will receive in `Coord$render_axis_(h|v)()`, much like it does with `panel_params`. \r\n\r\nI've gotten to versions to work (i.e., pass CMD check with no visual changes), one of which \"injects\" the panel guides into `panel_params$guides` in `Layout$render()` ( https://github.com/tidyverse/ggplot2/compare/master...paleolimbot:issue-3322-guide-axis-panel-params ), and the other of which adds a `panel_guides` argument to `Coord$render_axis_(h|v)()` and `Facet$draw_panels()` ( https://github.com/tidyverse/ggplot2/compare/master...paleolimbot:issue-3322-guide-axis-layout ). The first one I think is way better since it doesn't result in breaking any extensions of `Facet`s or `Coords`.\r\n\r\nIt might be possible to avoid any changes outside `CoordCartesian` (as well as some other guide code) if the guides were generated at build time, but then they wouldn't have access to the same things that the other guides do (layers, default mapping, global guides list).",

These are my current thoughts in how to get user information about the position guides and get it to where the guides are drawn:\r\n\r\n## User-facing guide code\r\n\r\n- Guides that represent one scale should use the current infrastructure for specifying guides (i.e., `scale_(x|y)_*(guide = ...)` / `guides((x|y) = ...)`). The only difference from other guide code is that I think the default should be `waiver()` in the scale functions so that the coordinate system can pick the default guide.\r\n\r\n- Guides that represent more than one scale (e.g., `guide_grid()`) should be specified in the `coord_*()` constructor. This is already (sort of) the case for the `guide_graticule()` in `coord_sf()`, and I don't see any reason that we need to add any arguments to other coords at this time, since there really isn't any reason to cutomize the `guide_grid()` that can't already happen in the theme settings. Other panel guides are currently possible as layers (like `annotation_logticks()` or `ggspatial::annotation_scale()`)...the only difference is that layers do not have access to the `theme` at draw time.\r\n\r\n## Internal guide code\r\n\r\n- Currently, guides are resolved, trained, exposed to the layers (to draw the glyphs), and turned into grobs at draw time (i.e., in `ggplot_gtable()`). I don't see any reason that this can't be the case for position guides as well.\r\n\r\n- Currently, all guides have exactly one `position` defined by the `theme()`. This should remain the case for the current guide code, but for position guides I think that guides should have a vector of positions so that code like `guide_graticule(position = c(\"left\", \"bottom\", \"foreground\"))` and `guide_axis(position = c(\"left\", \"right\"))` is possible.\r\n\r\n- Currently, all guides are trained with one scale and one scale only. This won't work for all position guides, which I think should be trained using a list of scales (just like that passed to `Stat$compute_*()`). This implies a different training process for position guides, which I think is necessary anyway. From much experimentation trying to get position scales/guides to survive the existing guide code, I think that new training code should be written, and eventually the rest of the guides should switch to using it. Because position guides are going to need separate training code, I think it makes sense to write them as `ggproto()` objects whose state is internal (like scales).\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n\r\n```r\r\nGuide <- ggproto(\r\n  \"Guide\", NULL,\r\n  title = NULL,\r\n  position = NULL,\r\n  aesthetics = NULL,\r\n  data = NULL,\r\n  \r\n  # I *think* this is enough information to perform the merge externally\r\n  # NULL = never merge\r\n  hash = function(self, scale) {\r\n    # title <- scale$make_title(guide$title %|W|% scale$name %|W|% labels[[output]])\r\n    # digest::digest(list(title, self$aesthetics, class(self), scale$get_labels())\r\n    NULL\r\n  },\r\n  \r\n  # encompases the current guide_train() and guide_geom()\r\n  train = function(scales, layers, default_mapping) {\r\n    # self$data <- ...\r\n    # invisible(self$data)\r\n    stop(\"Not implemented\", call. = FALSE)\r\n  },\r\n  \r\n  # position is because guides may look different depending on where they are\r\n  # drawn. It is the caller's responsibility to put the grob in the\r\n  # right place\r\n  draw = function(self, theme, coord, position = NULL) {\r\n    stop(\"Not implemented\", call. = FALSE)\r\n  }\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n- Position guides should be resolved by the coordinate system and added to the `panel_params` as the `guides` element. This happens at draw time rather than build time, so it needs to be a new method in the `Coord`. They should go in the `panel_params` because they are already everywhere the guides are drawn (i.e., no new arguments!). We are also narrowing in to a point where there is a common structure to `panel_params` for all coords (`$x` and `$y` will soon be scale-like objects always, and `$guides` will be a `list()` of trained guides).\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n\r\n```r\r\nCoordCartesian <- ggproto(\r\n  ...,\r\n  setup_panel_guides = function(self, panel_params, guides, params) {\r\n    scales <- panel_params[c(\"x\", \"y\")]\r\n    panel_guides <- list(\r\n      x = guides$x %||% scales$x$guide %|W|% guide_axis(),\r\n      y = guides$y %||% scales$y$guide %|W% guide_axis(),\r\n      guide_grid(aesthetics = c(\"x\", \"y\"), position = \"foreground\")\r\n    )\r\n    # resolve guide objects\r\n    panel_guides <- lapply(panel_guides, validate_guide)\r\n    # set default positions and aesthetics if they aren't set\r\n    panel_guides <- lapply(panel_guides, ...)\r\n    # add to panel_params\r\n    panel_params$guides <- lapply(panel_guides, validate_guide)\r\n    \r\n    panel_params\r\n  }\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n- The `Coord` should also train the guides, but maybe not in the same place as resolving them. This mostly reflects different information requirements and helps keep all the functions short. Also, this means that coordinate systems that don't participate in the new system are left alone.\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n\r\n```r\r\nCoordCartesian <- ggproto(\r\n  ...,\r\n  train_panel_guides = function(self, panel_params, layers, default_mapping, params) {\r\n    scales <- panel_params[c(\"x\", \"y\")]\r\n    if (is.null(panel_params$guides)) {\r\n      return()\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    scales <- panel_params[c(\"x\", \"y\")]\r\n    lapply(panel_params$guides, function(guide) guide$train(scales, ))\r\n    invisible(panel_params)\r\n  }\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n- The `Layout` will have to pass the `guides`, `layers`, and `default_mapping` to these methods. These are all available in `ggplot_gtable()`, which calls the method.\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n\r\n```r\r\nLayout <- ggproto(\r\n  ...,\r\n  setup_panel_guides = function(self, guides, layers, default_mapping) {\r\n    self$panel_params <- lapply(\r\n      self$panel_params,\r\n      self$coord$setup_panel_guides,\r\n      guides, \r\n      self$coord_params\r\n    )\r\n    \r\n    self$panel_params <- lapply(\r\n      self$panel_params,\r\n      self$coord$train_panel_guides,\r\n      layers, \r\n      default_mapping,\r\n      self$coord_params\r\n    )\r\n    \r\n    invisible()\r\n  }\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n- Then, the `Coord` has access to trained guides in its `panel_params`, which already get passed to `Coord$render_*()` by the `Facet`.\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n\r\n```r\r\nCoordCartesian <- ggproto(\r\n  ...,\r\n  render_bg = function(panel_params, theme) {\r\n    guides <- get_guides(panel_params, \"background\")\r\n    ...\r\n  },\r\n  render_fg = function(panel_params, theme) {\r\n    guides <- get_guides(panel_params, \"foreground\")\r\n    ...\r\n  },\r\n  render_axis_h = function(panel_params, theme) {\r\n    guides_top <- get_guides(panel_params, \"top\")\r\n    guides_bottom <- get_guides(panel_params, \"bottom\")\r\n    list(top = ..., bottom = ...)\r\n  },\r\n  render_axis_v = function(panel_params, theme) {\r\n    guides_left <- get_guides(panel_params, \"left\")\r\n    guides_right <- get_guides(panel_params, \"right\")\r\n    list(left = ..., right = ...)\r\n  }\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\nThoughts?

This is not really a pathological example; \"outliers\" are a common feature of statistical analyses and visualization.\r\n\r\n> I still don't see any reason why one would ever want to use an exp transform when the untransformed numbers are in the thousands.\r\n\r\nThe `exp` of these values are being passed to the _secondary_ axis because it is a _secondary_ representation. Llog values are what we care about, but log values are less human-readable. Imagine making a figure to be read by non-statisticians and statistician alike.  You would want both the log scale and exp scale.\r\n\r\nManually subsetting the data frame to exclude the values that cause underflow and hence trigger the non-monotone transformation error message before passing the data frame to `ggplot` would lose information, since the primary axis _is_ the log scale. And such manual subsetting would be pathological and hacky.",

The second approach seems to be working as expected. \r\n\r\nWhen I used the first approach, after `scale_y_continuous` (replacing `coord_trans`) in my code above, the alternate shading effects were gone . But they were preserved with `coord_trans`. Do you see anything wrong in my code or is it something to do with `scale_y_continuous trans` args?\r\n\r\nThanks a lot for the help.\r\n\r\n",

The correct approach is to write a function factory that generates the specific key drawing function you need at that point in time. Just as we do, for example, with `scales::number_format()` to generate functions that format numbers.\r\n\r\nWhen I wrote the `draw_key` patch I already had plans to write a function factory that can generate a broad range of key drawing functions that draw square keys. I just never got around to doing it, and I'm also not entirely sure whether it belongs into ggplot2 or into an extension package. If I have time over the next few days maybe I'll write an example implementation of what I have in mind. ",

In case anyone has similar issues i'll elaborate.\r\n\r\nI\u2019ve built a number of dashboards using the R option in Power BI. These graphs are in essence an in-built version of R in a dashboard with the R scripts running in the background.\r\nI had written a comment in here stating that it was resolved by recreating the report but that is no longer true. Will check with Power BI to see if any other users are having the same issues and see what they recommend. \r\n",

At that parsing stage, the number with a comma as separator is not understood. I don't remember now why I wrote the code this way, but there was a valid reason for it. I think it's because we build an internal data frame that holds x and y labels in the same column, and it is possible that only one of the two sets of labels uses plotmath.\r\n\r\nOne general solution may be to store everything as plotmath, rather than everything as strings. Turning numbers into strings may also work. Finally, if the R locale settings are changed so it understands a comma as a separator (I assume this is possible, I never use it) things should also work.",

The reason why the italics isn't picked up is because `ansi_to_html()` uses CSS to set the italics font style, and that isn't yet implemented in gridtext (it currently expects the `<i>` or `<em>` tags).  However, it's possible to mix crayon and markdown (see below), so this is not that big of an issue. And in any case, support for `font-style:italic` is easy to add.\r\n\r\n```r\r\nglue_html <- function(txt, ...){\r\n  txt <- withr::with_package(\"crayon\", glue::glue(txt, ...))\r\n  ansistrings::ansi_to_html(text = txt, fullpage = FALSE)\r\n}\r\n\r\nglue_html(\"{blue$italic('I. setosa')}\")\r\n\r\n#> <span style=\"color:#3465a4\"><span style=\"font-style:italic\">I. setosa</span></span>\r\n```\r\nCould you file an issue for the [gridtext package](https://github.com/clauswilke/gridtext/issues)? The right way to do this would be to add an `element_crayon()` (see below). One problem, though, is that crayon auto-detects whether colors are available, and it apparently doesn't work inside of R Markdown.

Something like order = \"numeric\", \"alphabetic\", \"yValue\", and the a secondary component that allows me to stipulate ascending or descending. This would make my life a lot easier for all graphics I produce in ggplot - not just this one example. \r\n\r\nI understand there are lots of work-arounds. However, I do strongly believe for such an advanced and widely used package such features should be incorporated into the base source code. ",

It looks to me like you're not sufficiently familiar with how aesthetic mappings and scales work, and therefore you are surprised when ggplot2 does exactly what you ask it to do.\r\n\r\nI recommend that you read some introductory texts about ggplot2. For example, Kieran Healy's book (http://socviz.co/) is great. It discusses your specific problem in Chapter 3.5: http://socviz.co/makeplot.html#mapping-aesthetics-vs-setting-them\r\n\r\nIf you have further questions about ggplot2 usage, the R Studio forums would be a more appropriate venue.",

It's not a \"workaround\", but how ggplot2's grouping works.\r\n\r\nWhen you don't specify `group` aesthetic explicitly, ggplot2 guesses the grouping structure from other variables (this time it was `colour`).

Since `font_descent()` is only used by `title_spec()` and that is not vectorized, maybe it's best to let `font_descent()` return only the first result? In general, the fact that `title_spec()` is not properly vectorized causes all sorts of problems, but fixing that is a pretty substantial rewrite, and probably better left to something like the gridtext package.",

Leaving the technical details aside, a theme *can* be tightly coupled with the exact plot; For example, it depends on the length of labels how much angle we should rotate the labels. Using the analogy of HTML and CSS, they are designed to separate theming from the data, but, in practice, elaborated CSSs are so tightly coupled with the exact HTMLs that they cannot be reused easily.",

The root error comes from `library()` - if you attach a package that is already loaded, `library()` compares the package version between the loaded version and the on disk version, and attempts to [unload and reload](https://github.com/wch/r-source/blob/d1f01dc790201e2e40c97e8da45c51c495874ffe/src/library/base/R/library.R#L277-L293).  `library()` is called by [`.test_load_package()`](https://github.com/wch/r-source/blob/89ec1150299f7be62b839d5d5eb46bd9a63653bd/src/library/tools/R/admin.R#L918), which is called by [`install.packages`](https://github.com/wch/r-source/blob/17ea295025dcd71a5834a787c51380a358e7274c/src/library/tools/R/install.R#L1213) as part of a check to ensure the package has been installed somewhere. `.test_load_package()` is run in another R session but not with `--vanilla`.\r\n\r\nMy hypothesis is that somewhere in the bowels of `library()` a function doesn't pass `lib.loc` along, so it ends up using the version of the package you currently have installed in one place, and the version you're trying to install in another. This is hypothesis is supported by two fixes that work for me:\r\n\r\n* Remove `R_LIBS` from my `~/.Renviron`\r\n* Install ggplot2 from CRAN\r\n\r\nI think this explains why we each see failures with slightly different packages: I have a dev version of ggplot2 and I'm guessing that @klmr has dev tidyr and @jbromley has dev tibble.",

That is, the output from `attach` is generating the tick signs, and a component of pandoc is not happy with them (Unicode in a UTF8 context) when it tries to generate LaTeX on the way to PDF.\r\n\r\nWe're trying to see if we can make changes to pandoc to accommodate the issue but... digging into pandoc issues has historically been about as fun as diving into a swimming pool filled only with masonry fragments and rebar. I don't know how attached (_ha!_) you are to the ticks and special x characters, but maybe keeping simple ascii tokens (+/-) would be more portable?\r\n\r\nWe also tried to suppress attachment output with `library(\"tidyverse\", quietly=TRUE)` but the output was still generated; It would be handy if the `quietly` flag was detected there, though I'm not certain that's the intended role of that flag. Our other option is to attach tidyverse prior to knitting, or at least in a kintr block where the output isn't captured, but then we don't have the nice package manifest that it generates.\r\n\r\nThanks!",

Are you opening some sort of saved workspace? \r\nHave you recently updated the tidyverse package?\r\nWhat happens if you load another package first? \r\nIt makes more sense with `read_csv()` as, in so doing you're reading in values\u2026\r\n\r\nSee https://github.com/tidyverse/purrr/issues/403 for an example, and/or this thread, [What is integer overflow in R and how can it happen?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8804779/what-is-integer-overflow-in-r-and-how-can-it-happen), on StackOverflow.\r\n\r\nSince tidyverse is a meta-package, it seems unlikely that whatever is producing this is internal to the specific package. You might want to ask about this on [community.rstudio.com](https://community.rstudio.com/) (along with some of the answers to the questions I listed above) where more people can help you troubleshoot (and if it _does_ turn out to be a tidyverse package bug, we can address it with more information here).",

I do not remember when was the last time I've updated tidyverse.\r\n3. Every single package I've tried, after opening RStudio, gives me the same warning. Therefore, I tend to think it is something related to the IDE--I've been running the 1.2.830 preview, but I've just seen there is a newer one. \r\n\r\nThank you for the provided links. I had already been reading through them, but my case seemed very weird. \r\n\r\nGiven the 3rd point above, feel free to close this issue.

So for future people stumbling upon this thread, if you are using a new computer with High Sierra or Mojave and would like to install R fresh, you'll likely run into this same error as @gvwilson if you used Homebrew `brew` to install R as in:\r\n\r\n`$ brew install r`\r\n\r\nI did this via a Homebrew Brewfile, and it was the source of my `xml2` problem. So first I undid that install using:\r\n\r\n`$ brew uninstall r`\r\n\r\nThis means I was OK with torching all my installed packages, because I was on a new computer I was OK with this!\r\n\r\nThen I used Homebrew to install the `r-app` via cask:\r\n\r\n`$ brew cask install r-app`\r\n\r\nAfter doing that, I was able to install the `tidyverse` package (and all my other packages) without problems.\r\n\r\nMy updated Brewfile then looked like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\ntap 'homebrew/cask'\r\ncask 'r-app'\r\n```",

In the past I was able to get around this with `$ conda deactivate` then `R> install.packages() that need XML2` then `$ conda activate base` (or whatever your env of choice is). I also just happened upon the suggestion @apreshill mentioned, and it helps a lot with problems like this, because now you can install the precompiled package binaries from CRAN instead of having to compile them yourself.\r\nThank you very much, I've never tough about conda screw up..",

You are not alone in finding this confusing:\r\n\r\n> The package namespace (as recorded in the NAMESPACE file) is one of the more confusing parts of building a package\r\n\r\n-- [R Packages / NAMESPACE](http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/namespace.html)\r\n\r\nJenny's suggestion is great. Here are some pointers that might help you prepare to lead the discussion:\r\n\r\n* > It really depends on how you expect your package to be used. If it is a 'true' meta-package and really has no additional functionality itself I think just using Depends is the best option, so users can just `install.packages(\"metapackage\"); library(metapackage)` and have all the child packages attached.\r\n\r\n--  Jim Hester \r\n\r\n* > Listing a package in either Depends or Imports ensures that it\u2019s installed when needed. [W]here Imports just loads the package, Depends attaches it. There are no other differences. \r\n\r\n-- [R Packages / NAMESPACE](http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/namespace.html)\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Can you try removing (`remove.packages()`) purrr and then reinstalling it and see what happens? I understand that the problem is occurring when you are loading the tidyverse package, but it's still likely that the problem occurs when `pluck()` is called (and `pluck()` is in purrr).\r\n\r\nThanks.",
