## 1. Overview

In the previous assignment, you had an opportunity to practice doing analysis about topic modelling and sentiment analysis on Twitter. In this assignment, you’ll build upon those skills and work in a team to solve/answer an interesting problem, analysis or question of your choice using social media and networks data.
The goals of the master programs and of RMIT graduates in general are the ability to problem solve, to work in teams and to be able to communicate. This assignment aims to contribute towards your development in these crucial areas. It is essentially a cross between a hackathon and a final year project, where you work on a problem to solve or answer in a team, and in a length of time that is between a hackathon and a final year project.

The assignment can be broken up into a few parts, corresponding to how you could approach it (and also corresponding with the marking rubric). The parts are as follows, and in the following we’ll provide further details of each:

- Team formation
- Problem/Question construction
- Team management & Mentoring
- Perform the analysis/Solve the problem
- Communicating the results or analysis

## Team Formation
This assignment is a team one, in groups of 3. This allows the scope to be larger so more interesting problems or analysis can be done, as well as allowing you to support each other in a team.

Initial task of the assignment is to form the teams. We can help you with this if you are having problems, but our suggestion is to select team members with similar approach to assignments and study. Ideally you also want a team with a good mix of skills, e.g., analytics, programming/data collection, communications etc. Of course, if everyone are strong in all areas that would be great.

Once you confirmed, go to Canvas, we will setup groups for assignment 2, where you can self-assign to one of the teams. Please only enter your group assignment once you have the team formed and if your team has less than 3 members, please kindly contact us to explain your thoughts about this. Please do not put yourself in a team on Canvas in the hope others will join you, as that clogs up the assignment teams – use the appropriate discussion forum for that.

## Problem or Question Construction

You’ll also need to select the problem or question(s) to work on. Here, we’ll like your team to discuss, and then for each team to meet with one of us in person or via Skype and equivalent to ensure that the problem/question is interesting (i.e., non-trivial) but doable in the 5 weeks you have. The assignment will not be marked if you haven’t met us to discuss the problem by the 2nd week (end of September 25th). This is our friendly way to get you started!

### As a guide about the scope of problems that are doable, consider the following:

- Depression and suicide alert on social media
- Beyond statistics, who is the best and most influential cricketer?
- Who is the centre of the Marvel/Nintendo universe? Can we promote Browser to be the most
central Nintendo head honcho?
- Github & communities – all things about community analysis on Github.
- Donald vs Kim – who has the bigger ego?
- Social Media Neighbourhood Watch – Alerts for where, when and what crimes are been committed in Melbourne?

If you look at the problems, some are more analysis/research in nature, others are about solving a problem. This is not an exhaustive list. There is no bias towards the different types, as we understand each of you have different backgrounds and knowledge and interest, so would like to leave it open to you. There are some constraints that your assignment should adhere to though:

- Must include at least one source of social media and networks.
- Must include a graph or network and its analysis/processing to solve a problem.
- Must include some element of analysis using social media and networks, and something we learnt in class. It cannot be all machine learning for example.
- Your analyst or solution is in Python (no R, including visualisation), but parts of it could be done in
other languages, e.g., Javascript if you decide to prototype a front end on website.
- All code should be your own, you can leverage packages such as networkx etc., but it shouldn’t be copied from an existing solution.

If unsure please contact us.

### Team Management & Mentoring

Although it isn’t part of this course, we know from our previous experiences as a student and lecturer that there are potential difficulties when working in a team. Some of you are very experienced in working as a team, others may do with a few pointers, so the following is some advice and suggestions that can help with your team dynamics and management:

- Each team is different and what works best is team dependent, but the most successful teams usually have either all highly motivated and self-disciplined members or a team leader who ensures the teams don’t lose sight of targets and drive the team towards them. Regardless of style, we strongly suggest to nominate a leader, and to agree upon vesting some authority with them, e.g., keep everyone on track etc.
- Set up regular meetings within your team, whether in person, on Skype or Slack. Have an agenda for each meeting, and a plan for the assignment.
- Communicate with each other and try to stick to timelines/plans. If can’t stick to them, have remedial actions.

The following are suggestions as well as requirements:

- Once you have someone as the team leader, please specify within the canvas groups. We’ll mainly liaison with the leaders (from our end) and the leader can disseminate the information to the team members.
- Use timesheets and other means to record progress, which is part of your submissions and to avoid arguments later about contributions, and setup a code repository (e.g., Github or Bitbucket) and/or Google drive to easily share code. The repository/shared drive is a good way to keep everything together and also to ensure progress is made. In the event there is an argument about contributions, it is also a way for us to resolve who did what.

In addition to the above, we’ll like each team to meet one of us at least 3 times before the assignment is due. Once to discuss problem, once to discuss progress and your approach, and one in the final phrase of the assignment. Consider this as mentorship or guidance from us, as well as helping you with keeping on track. If you look at the marking rubric, there are marks associated with this.

We will set some appointment slots on a calendar (unfortunately Outlook doesn’t provide this natively). If that doesn’t work, we’ll setup a Doodle or some other approach for you to select a slot to meet.
Perform the Analysis/Solve the Problem

The next component is to gather the necessary data, proceed with your analysis and iterate. For this part, we encourage you to use any of the tools and techniques we have studied in class, but you are also most welcome to use techniques you have studied in other classes – e.g., data visualisation, time series, machine learning etc. The only restriction here is that all content in the report and presentation should be in Python or the analysis originated from Python and some visualisation tool was then used, it must use social media and networks, and it must use some elements of what we have studied in this course – i.e., text or NLP, social network analysis and behaviour analysis (see constraints about problem above). Do exploration of approaches, but I also want you to give consideration of why you are trying an approach and how it might help you solve the goals of your assignment.

## Communication
Final component is to communicate your solution, analysis and discussions. This is done in two ways. One is via a report, much like what you did for assignment 1. The second is a group presentation, where we want each group to present and “pitch” their problem and analysis during the last week of the semester.

### Sources of Help
We would be very happy to discuss questions and your results with you. Please feel free to come talk to us during consultation, or even a quick question, during lecture break. Use the existing communication channels you have been using with us also.

Also, you can ask questions on Canvas, but please do not post any code.

There will also be a FAQ, and anything in the FAQ will override what is specified in this specification, if there is ambiguity.

## 2. Assessment Criteria

This assessment will determine your ability to:

- Analyse and problem-solving skills developed in course and assignment 1 to use social media & network analysis to solve or answer data related questions/problems
- Collect and explore data
- Develop written and verbal communication of describing the problem, approach, analysis, insights and justification of approach taken.

## 3. Learning Outcomes

This assessment is relevant to the following Learning Outcomes:

1. Apply data science to analyse social media and social networks
2. Analyse social networks by finding communities, identifying important nodes, and influence
propagation
3. Analyse social media by applying Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to detect sentiment and events
4. Describe the theoretical concepts behind the social media and network analytical approaches
5. Synthesise and present insights from the social media and network analysis performed

## 4. Assessment details

The assessment is based on your presentation, report and your progress.
Examine the assessment rubric at the end of the document.
You’ll be assessed on how well you communicated your work, on the problem selected, how your team went about the assignment and your insights/solution. As a rough rule of thumb, you can get a credit if you just used the code we learnt in class, but to get a high distinction would require you doing some research and going beyond what we did in class.


In addition, part of your assessment would be self-reflection on your own performance and your team’s performance. Here you may add any additional information you’ll like to inform us of difficulties that we didn’t cover in the meetings. I’ll also like you to provide an estimate of the work breakdown (via timesheets and your assessment of contributions in the self-reflection), and to ensure as even work distribution as possible, it will up to our discretion for marks redistribution if the workload is unreasonably unbalanced.

## 5. Referencing guidelines

What: This is an individual assignment and all submitted contents must be your own. If you have used sources of information other than the contents directly under Canvas→Modules, you must give acknowledge the sources and give references using IEEE referencing style.
Where: Add a code comment near the work to be referenced and include the reference in the IEEE style. How: To generate a valid IEEE style reference, please use the citethisforme tool if unfamiliar with this style. Add the detailed reference before any relevant code (within code comments).

## 6. What to submit

- Your report, up to 30 A4 pages in length and in font size 12 of assessed content, not including appendices. Note this is a maximum, not a length you need to must have. Anything beyond 30 pages will not be read, and anything in appendix should be considered as additional information, as there is no guarantee it will be read. Please do not ask for more pages, this limit is strict.
- Your scripts used to perform your analysis. Please comment and style the code, as we will read them. Note that we may also ask you to explain the code and why you chose particular coding choices.
- Share access with me to your code and/or document shared repository or drive. Include the details how I can access it.
- Timesheets, project plans, individual self-reflection (max of one A4 page)
- A sample of the data, no more than 10 Mb in size.

Submission should be made to Canvas. Closer to submission we will describe the submission process in more detail.

## Presentation

More details about the presentation/pitch will be available when we get closer to it, but essentially your team should tell the class about the (exciting) problem or question your team tackled, who you think it is an important/useful/interesting/exciting, your approach and your results, solution or insight. There should be time allocated for questions also.

## 7. Academic integrity and plagiarism (standard warning)
Academic integrity is about honest presentation of your academic work. It means acknowledging the work of others while developing your own insights, knowledge and ideas. You should take extreme care that you have:

- Acknowledged words, data, diagrams, models, frameworks and/or ideas of others you have quoted (i.e. directly copied), summarised, paraphrased, discussed or mentioned in your assessment through the appropriate referencing methods,
- Provided a reference list of the publication details so your reader can locate the source if necessary. This includes material taken from Internet sites.
If you do not acknowledge the sources of your material, you may be accused of plagiarism because you have passed off the work and ideas of another person without appropriate referencing, as if they were your own.
RMIT University treats plagiarism as a very serious offence constituting misconduct. Plagiarism covers a variety of inappropriate behaviours, including:
- Failure to properly document a source
- Copyright material from the internet or databases
- Collusion between students
For further information on our policies and procedures, please refer to the University website. 

## 8. Assessment declaration
When you submit work electronically, you agree to the assessment declaration.
