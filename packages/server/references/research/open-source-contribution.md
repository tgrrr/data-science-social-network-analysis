Problem:
> Major drawback: when searching issues by label in Github, we cannot use "OR" operator. Basically, we cannot search for issue having labels GOOD FIRST CONTRIBUTION OR UP FOR GRABS in one query. Therefore, the trick to get the issues that could be of interest is to query repositories that have issues matching our labels' list. The unfortunate consequence is that the list of issues listed in a repository can sometimes be empty... which leads sometimes to get a list of 20 repositories with no issues at all to display... That is the reason why the fetch more button might need to be smashed several times before finding new issues to display... A naive idea of mine was to query again a new list of repositories when zero issues are returned but launching network requests recursively does not seem like a good idea...ahem...
